1.
add a load_tables_in_memory() functionality
that when you run main.o, it loads all of the tables in the memory, 
in an organized way, so the reading is fast 

2.
add a LRUCache for each table 

3.
add a limitation for each table (10k entries max)
in the metadata for each table, add a line that indicates the number of entries,
which increments each time you add something, and decrements each time you delete something
